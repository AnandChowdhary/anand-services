# Services

These are some services, cron jobs, automated scripts, etc., I run.

Thanks to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for hosting these services for free. :smile:

## `/services/wayback`

[Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) is a digital archive of the web. This script is scheduled as a cron job and takes a digital backup of my personal website by parsing its sitemap daily.
